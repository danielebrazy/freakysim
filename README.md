Absolutely useless and boring aah code to simulate some fresky interaction shit between particles. 
At this point I honestly struggle trying to understand the sense of this all, I would not even be able to tell how I happened to end up here or to give myself a good reason why I should not fucking drop that hairdryer in the bathtub and finally make this farce end, once and forever. 
I guess at the end the only reason why I am still alive is cowardice, this making me even more miserable if possible.



Segmentation violation btw...
